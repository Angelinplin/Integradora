After experiencing the trauma of being hunted, now you'll have the opportunity to exact revenge by following in his footsteps. Embrace the darkness within and unleash your inner chef as you turn the tables on your former tormentor. Will you succumb to the same malevolent desires, or will you forge your own path to justice?.",
